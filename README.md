# Neuro Swarm Disruptor (NSD)

**Project by ChaosTech Defense LLC**  
**Founder:** Daivon M. Brown  
**SEED Protocol:** FIREFLY

---

### Overview

The **Neuro Swarm Disruptor (NSD)** is a field-deployable, chaos-driven signal disruption device engineered for tactical military and defense operations. Designed to confuse, neutralize, or redirect drone swarms and autonomous systems through non-linear RF chaos generation.

This repository contains early-stage technical documentation, architecture flows, firmware pseudocode, and open collaboration opportunities for elite engineers and innovators.

### Objectives

- Deploy chaos-based RF interference against enemy drone swarms.
- Utilize stealth-mode architecture with solar-powered operation.
- Achieve full waterproof, buttonless, portless design using a touch interface.
- Integrate FIREFLY: a tactical chaos signal generation protocol.
